# Project3
COP 2805 Project 3 - Search Engine
A first in a series of group projects for the Advanced Java Course

Group Name: JSTAN
Group Members:
  Jonathan Girwar-Nath
  Saurel Cerome
  Thomas Sclichler
  Alexander Infante
  Nathan Boyle (departed group member)

Project Scope: 
 In this first part, your group must design and implement a non-functional graphic user interface for the application.  The UI must support both searching as well as various index operations: adding files to the index, remove files from the index, and update the index (when files have been modified since they were indexed).

The UI should be complete, but none of the functionality needs to be implemented at this time.  Create stub methods for the functions not yet implemented, and invoke them from your event handlers.  The stub methods can either return “canned” (fake but realistic) data, or throw an appropriate exception. 

Division of Labor:
Since the scope and depth of this project was small, it was deicided that each member of the group would create their own user interface and after the last commit on at 23:59 Wednesday, the group members would choose which interface was best an that interface would be the one used throughout the remainder of the project (even if minor adjustments need to be made to the interface).  The chosen interface's author  would be the change advisor for the next project.

Jonathan took was the first change advisor for the group. The responsibilities were to create the master branch and include all team members as collaborators. Once this step was complete, each group member created their separate branch that would then be pushed into Master and finally submitted on the project due date.

JSTAN created user interfaces to be pushed to their branches. Links to these branches will be included in the final submission so each member will be given his fair share of credit.
